        <h1> Blog 1 - Why Sunsets Bring Peace </h1>
<br>
        <h2> October 20th, 2021 by: Ariana Parker</h2>
<br>
        <p> Sunsets are not only the end to a day, but they are symbols of peace, 
            harmony, and the promise of renewal.  I love watching sunsets because
             they brighten my mood, and they help me relax and reset after a rough day. 
             Sunsets show me that even if my day was bad, it can still end beautifully 
             and bring me peace.  I think peace is very important especially with how the 
             world is right now, watching a sunset and just calming the mind for five to ten minutes
              can be very beneficial to those who are very stressed.  
              <br> I live by the River Trail, and I have been seeing more and more people out during 
              sunset hour and it makes me happy to see others putting themselves first.

           <br> This is a sunset I caught the night before a test I was really stressed out about and
             I saw there for about twenty minutes reading, watching, and calming the mind.  
             The next day when I finished the test it was the best grade I had received on a test 
             for this class, and I feel that it was from watching the sunset and relaxing my mind 
             the night before.  So many benefits!

             <h1> Blog 2 - Sunrises Are Special</h1>

             <h2> October 20th, 2021 by: Ariana Parker</h2>
             
             <br>

             <p> The first time I woke up early to catch a sunrise was in 2016.  
                 I was in Ocean City, Maryland and was staying by the beach.  I set
                  about three alarms and woke up at 5:30am, got ready, and headed down 
                  to the beach.  While I waited for the sun to start rising, I wrote in 
                  my journal about the morning so far and how I was feeling.  I also played 
                  music and read.  
                  <br>
                  When the sun started to come up, I took some pictures and
                   then recorded a time lapse the rest of the time.  It was the prettiest 
                   sunrise I had ever seen and since that day I made sure to wake up every 
                   day to watch the sunrises.
                <br>
                I realized that they made my days a lot better, made me feel very productive, 
                and happy!  Sunrises also symbolize not only the start of the day but a new 
                beginning.  I think both sunrises and sunsets give us a better sense of gratitude 
                for the earth which is always very important.  Being caught up in the natural 
                beauty of the earth.  I love the high levels of satisfaction and gratitude for 
                what is happening right in front of me!
