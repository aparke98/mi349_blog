    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Ariana Parker, 23 years old and a senior at Michigan State University.
   <br> I graduate in the Spring!  Before Michigan State I attended a small college in Pennsylvania
   <br> called Mercyhurst University on a soccer scholarship.  I played goalie and was there for two years,
    <br> getting my Associates in Social Media Marketing.
<br>
       <br> My hobbies
      <br>  - Sports
      <br>  - Photography
      <br>  - Travelling
      <br>  - Yoga
      <br>  - Nature
<br>
           <br> I love watching sports and playing soccer!  Photography has always been a passion of mine but recently
       <br> got more into it and I am learning a lot more which is something I also enjoy, learning.  Yoga is
        <br> something that I got into over the pandemic and it has helped relieve so much stress that staying inside
       <br> has brought.
          <br>  
          <br>  Nature and travelling has always brought me so much peace because it gives me a chance to reset and finished
      <br>  myself again.  It is always good to have a reset and put yourself first.
